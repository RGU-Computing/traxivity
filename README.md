<p align="center">
    Traxivity is a reusable module which features step counting and its analytics that you can use in your react-native app in order to help your users have their physical activity in check by maintaining and keep track of a daily step goal.
    <br />
</p>

## Prerequisites

We are constantly trying to make the module as independent as possible but at this stage, we only support the projects with following dependencies.

1. Google Fit (<a href="https://github.com/StasDoskalenko/react-native-google-fit">react-native-google-fit</a>)
2. Google Signin (<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/google-signin">react-native-google-signin</a>)
