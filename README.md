    Traxivity is reusable module that you can use in your react-native app in order to help your users to have their physical activity in check by maintaining and keep track of a daily step goal.

## Prerequisites

We are constantly trying to make the module as independent as possible but at this stage, we only support the projects with following dependencies.
